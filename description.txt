KArpReborn! Based (heavily) on Kalciphoz's RPG Mod (KRPG), this mod aims at bringing back the legendary mod with a new, shiny coat of paint!
It's Configurable! It's Extensible! It's Modularized!

This mod is the CORE module. It's needed for all of the other modules.
It implements KRPG's leveling and stat systems, with a few notable tweaks:

1. Enemies only grant experience to players who actively fought them. No more sacrificing enemies to the lava pit for XP, or getting a level because your friend across the map killed something.
2. Evasion has been overhauled. Enemies no longer get invincibility frames, and players get much shorter invincibility.
2.1. Evade chance calculation has been changed. Accuracy is now more important to build, and evasion-based characters need to focus it harder.
3. The old KRPG UI is, unfortunately, gone. The inventory system has been completely removed, rendering it useless. (The deer skull survived, though.)
